Not every Spark holder will want or be able to run hardware to contribute to the FTSO and separately they might not be interested in voting for network governance. Therefore the votes for both responsibilities can be detached from the token itself and separately delegated to other parties. The delegation may be cancelled at any time and when a token is transferred from one address to another the delegation is automatically cancelled such that the voting rights go with the token. The mechanism also allows SDA\u2019s such as FXRP to delegate Spark votes back to the ultimate owner who can then re-delegate those votes further to entities he wants to vote on his behalf. So if Bob has 5000 Spark tokens in the FXRP application, it will delegate the votes from those tokens to an address specified by Bob. If Bob wants a dedicated data provider to contribute to the FTSO on his behalf, Bob can then re-delegate his votes for the FTSO to the data provider. Importantly this means that Bob doesn\u2019t have to choose between earning Spark by providing collateral to the FXRP application and potentially earning the reward from the FTSO, he can do both. Any SDA that makes Spark tokens unavailable to their underlying owners, provided there is a definition in the application as to whom the underlying owner is, can implement the delegation procedure."),b("p",null,b(h.a,{as:"a",href:"https://flare.xyz",target:"_blank",color:"warning"},"Read more on Flare Network official website"))))))}}]),n}(s.Component)},md7G:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.d(t,"a",(function(){return a}));var o=n("U8pU"),r=n("JX7q");function a(e,t){return!t||"object"!==Object(o.a)(t)&&"function"!==typeof t?Object(r.a)(e):t}}},[["52dC",0,2,1,3,4,5,6]]]);
